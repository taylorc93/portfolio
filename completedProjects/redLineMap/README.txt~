Assignment 3: Where in the World? (Two tokens used for this assignment).

Link to the assignment: http://tuftsdev.github.com/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html

This assignment renders all the stations of the Red Line T in Boston using the Google
Maps API.  After the map is rendered, the location of the user is found and the nearest
T stop is determined.  The distance is displayed in an info window above the user's
marker.  The program also receives data from 2 AJAX servers, one of which holds JSON 
strings containing real time data about trains, the other holding the varying locations
of Waldo and Carmen Sandiego.  The 1st information is used to find when the next trains
will be arriving in a station when its marker is clicked and the 2nd is used to display
the locations of Waldo and Carmen on the map and find the distance from the user and 
each of them.

1. Everything seems to be working.

2. Everything in this assignment has been done by me.  However, I referenced the class
examples on google maps/geolocation and mbta.heroku.com to help render the map correctly
and display info windows. Trevor John also helped me fix my bugs for finding the distance
from waldo and carmen and displaying the schedule.  Finally, the haversine formula code was 
taken from: http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html

3. This project took me about 10 hours.
