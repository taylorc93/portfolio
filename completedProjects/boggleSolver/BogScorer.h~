/*	BogScorer Program
	Written by: Connor Taylor
	Date: 5/1/13
	This prorgram will take in a report that is sent to it from the BogValidator
	and figure out the score that the user should receive.  It outputs the score
	for each word the user sends and the total score along with the total number
	of words found.
